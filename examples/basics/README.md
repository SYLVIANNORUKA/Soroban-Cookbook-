# Basic Examples

Core Soroban fundamentals, one concept per example. Perfect for beginners starting their journey with Soroban smart contract development.

## 🎯 Learning Path

Follow this recommended sequence to build your understanding progressively:

1. Start with [01-hello-world](./01-hello-world/) to understand contract structure and deployment.
2. Learn storage patterns with [02-storage-patterns](./02-storage-patterns/) and its focused variants.
3. Study authentication and authorization in [03-authentication](./03-authentication/).
4. Add observability via events in [04-events] and [basic-event-emission].
5. Learn execution context with [05-auth-context].
6. Handle errors using [03-custom-errors] and [05-error-handling].
7. Explore types and conversions in [06-soroban-types], [06-type-conversions], and [10-data-types].
